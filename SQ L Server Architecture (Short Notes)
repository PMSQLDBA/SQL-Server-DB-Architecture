Here are short and easy-to-understand notes on SQL Server Architecture — ideal for interviews, training, or revision:

 🧱 SQL Server Architecture – Short Notes

🔄 1. Core Components

| Component                  | Description                                                      |
| ---------------------------| ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SQL Server Database Engine | Heart of SQL Server — handles storage, processing, and security  |
| SQL OS                     | Manages scheduling, memory, and I/O like an OS inside SQL Server |
| Relational Engine          | Parses, compiles, and executes T-SQL queries (Query Processor)   |
| Storage Engine             | Manages data storage, retrieval, transactions, and locking       |
| Buffer Pool                | Memory area for caching data pages and execution plans           |
| Transaction Log            | Ensures ACID compliance and recovery after failures              |


🧠 2. Memory Components

* Buffer Cache: Stores data pages read from disk
* Procedure Cache: Stores compiled query plans
* Log Buffer: Temporary memory area to hold transaction logs before writing to disk


📄 3. SQL Server Services

| Service                  | Purpose                                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) | Main database engine                      |
| SQL Server Agent         | Job scheduling and automation             |
| SQL Server Browser       | Helps clients connect to correct instance |
| Full-Text Search         | Enables fast text search capabilities     |


⚙️ 4. SQL Server Execution Flow (High-Level)

1. Client sends T-SQL query
2. Protocol layer receives and forwards the query
3. Parser parses and generates a query tree
4. Optimizer creates the best execution plan
5. Query Executor runs the plan
6. Storage Engine accesses data pages (from buffer pool or disk)
7. Results returned to client


🛡 5. ACID Compliance

* Atomicity: All or nothing
* Consistency: Data integrity maintained
* Isolation: Transactions don't affect each other
* Durability: Committed data is permanent
